# Node.JS Webform

### A webform the sends submitted info to a specified email address

## <p style="color: green;">Purpose</p>
This feature allowed for users to input information into a webform and have that webform submit the information to a specified email address. The webform was created using Bootstap and Cloudflare animate.css. I used node.JS with the nodemailer package to allow for emails to be sent after users click the submit button.
